Exercise Timer is a simple utility to conduct interval training. It is built for the GNOME desktop using [libadwaita](https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/libadwaita/doc/1.4/index.html) and [Relm4](https://relm4.org/).

## Installing

The recommended way of installing Exercise Timer is via Flathub.

<a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/xyz.safeworlds.hiit" target="_blank"><img width='240' alt='Get it on Flathub' src='https://flathub.org/api/badge?locale=en'/></a>

## üõ†Ô∏è Building the Flatpak

1. If not present, install `flatpak-builder`. It is most probably available in the operating system's package repository. E.g. on Fedora:

```bash
$ sudo dnf install -y flatpak-builder
```

2. If not present, add Flathub as a flatpak remote.

```bash
$ flatpak remote-add --user --if-not-exists flathub-verified https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
```

3. If not present, install the GNOME 49 Flatpak runtime and SDK and the Freedesktop SDK Rust and LLVM extensions.

```bash
$ flatpak install --user org.gnome.{Sdk,Platform}//49 org.freedesktop.Sdk.Extension.{rust-stable,llvm20}//25.08
```

4. Clone the current repository. Be aware that the binary assets are hosted in git LFS. **git LFS must be installed on the system to perform a proper checkout!**

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/mfep/exercise-timer.git
```

5. Build and install Exercise Timer with `flatpak-builder`!

```bash
$ cd exercise-timer
$ flatpak-builder --user --install --force-clean build ./build-aux/xyz.safeworlds.hiit.Devel.json
```
